# Nuuvem FrontEnd Testing

The project was developed using Javascript as a base. As a framework I used React associated with Next Js. And why Next js? Even not taking full advantage of the framework such as SSR (Server side rendering), automatic routes (created when creating folders inside the Pages folder), dynamic routes and using only some of its Tags, I believe that NextJs is the best way to optimize of applications in React. Only its implementation can provide improvements both in optimization and in Google ranking SEO. Despite being a small project, I used reusable componentization, inspired by the theory of the organization of atoms to form cells, tissues, organs, systems, etc. There was no need to create contexts.
